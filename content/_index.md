## Hi, my name is Pavel!

I'm passionate about start-ups, technology and business development. I have lived in 4 different countries, co-founded 3 start-ups and built several projects.

Currently, I am a CTO of start-up that sits at the edge between medicine and law.

Curiosity is what really drives me: my interest range from football to Artifical Intelligence. I am interested in psychology, leadership, travelling, learning, playing different sports.
I hold degrees of Bachelor of Laws from Lancaster University and Master of Science in Innovation, Strategy and Entrepreneurship from Grenoble Ecole de Management.
I have also independently learned how to code, which has spread my interests even wider.


I am skilled in Project Management, having worked with Agile methodologies like SCRUM and Kanban. I have extensive international experience, working with people from all over the world. During my both academic and professional lives, I have always been proactive: co-created a Festival of Entrepreneurship, co-founded and captained several sports teams, and, finally, opened a couple of businesess.


I can help you prototype and build your product and scale it to your needs. I can share my experience and expertise in Business Planning, Market and Competitive Researches. I can help you organize your workflow, and spread the word around you on Social Media.

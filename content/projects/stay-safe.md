# StaySafe

During the summer of 2017, Portugal has experienced several dangerous fire fires that took lives of 100+ people.
StaySafe attempted to impact this situation by showing people the impacted area, the safe route and notify people around if there is something happening.

StaySafe is a web-application that helps you and your family to be aware if your state and location during dangerous events.
It would notify you and your family if there is a hazardous event near you, and provide further instructions regarding the situation.

**Works best on mobile devices**

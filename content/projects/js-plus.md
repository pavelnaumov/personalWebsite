# JS Plus

JS Plus is a start-up that helps doctors and clinics to avoid law infringements and possible customer extremisms. 
We provide our clients with all the document workflow (such as contracts, forms, waivers, agreements, etc.) that is required by law, thus protecting them from the possible issues that could have arisen.

I have created the web-application and currently maintaining the project with plans of creating mobile applications, too.
